These are my detailed methods for my Capstone Project for the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) Specialization.

[Week 4](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week4) - *Alignment* (scroll down to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week4/README.md))

[Week 5](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week5) - *QC the Alignment* (scroll down to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week5/README.md))

[Week 6](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week6) - *Get Feature Counts* (scroll down a little to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week6/README.md))

[Week 7](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week7) - *Exploratory Analysis* (scroll down to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week7/README.md))

[Week 8](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week8) - *Statistical Analysis* (scroll down to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week8/README.md))

[Week 9](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/tree/main/Week9) - *Gene Set Analysis* (scroll down to see README.md content, or click [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Week9/README.md))

- To be clear, the **Week 9** assignment was *not* explicitly traditional gene set enrichment of the gene list from **Week 8** (of the re-analyzed RNA-Seq data from [Jaffe et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281298/))

- Instead, this is a test of robustness of the gene set defined in Week 8 of this project ***applied to other datasets***, which the required dataset being a different data type (where I might call this "*Promoter Analysis of Roadmap Epigenomics Project H3K4me3 Processed Data*")

- However, I **do** provide enrichment results among the filtered gene list.

[Week 10](https://github.com/cwarden45/JHU_Coursera_GDS_Capstone/blob/main/Methods_cwarden-Week10.pdf) - Upload overall summary report (no additional analysis for "*Describe Your Analysis*")

I also have notes about the 7 individual courses that need to be completed before the Capstone (as well as other on-line courses) [here](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2019/12/experiences-with-on-line-courses.html).

You can also see my certificates for the [Capstone](https://coursera.org/share/4a8104c102475500ad9b735d41d3cf1b) as well as the [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/3D38XL522GJX).
